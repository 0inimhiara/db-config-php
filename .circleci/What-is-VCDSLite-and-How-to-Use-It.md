## How to Download and Install VCDS-Lite?
 
To download VCDS-Lite, you need to visit the Ross-Tech website[^1^] and click on the self-installing distribution file. You need to save the file on your PC's hard disk and run it to install VCDS-Lite. You cannot run VCDS-Lite directly from a floppy or CD.
 
To install VCDS-Lite, you need to follow the prompts and accept the license agreement. You also need to have a compatible interface between your PC and your car. Ross-Tech does not supply interfaces for VCDS-Lite, but you can use some of their old interfaces or some third-party interfaces. However, you need to make sure that your interface works properly with your PC and your car before registering VCDS-Lite.
  
## How to Register and Activate VCDS-Lite?
 
To register VCDS-Lite, you need to purchase a license file from the Ross-Tech online store[^2^]. You need to provide your name, email address, and the serial number of your VCDS-Lite software. You can find the serial number by clicking on [Options] in VCDS-Lite and copying the number next to "Serial Number". You need to submit a valid serial number from VCDS-Lite, not from any older versions of VAG-COM.
 
To activate VCDS-Lite, you need to receive a license file from Ross-Tech by email. You need to save the file on your PC's hard disk and copy it to the same folder where you installed VCDS-Lite. You also need to have a means of moving data from your email to your target PC, such as a floppy drive, a LAN connection, or a USB memory key.
 
A license for VCDS-Lite entitles you to use the software on a single PC only. You cannot transfer or sell your license to anyone else. However, you can backup your license file in case you need to re-install VCDS-Lite or re-format your hard drive. Ross-Tech will also allow one change of PC per license in case your PC fails irreparably.
